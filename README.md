## What I Learned Today

### Comparison: Linux vs Windows

Today, I explored the fundamental differences between **Linux** and **Windows** operating systems. Below are the key points I learned:

* **Linux** is an **open-source** operating system, meaning its source code is publicly available. Anyone can view, modify, and distribute it.
* **Windows**, on the other hand, is a **closed-source** system controlled solely by Microsoft. Its code is proprietary and not accessible to the public.
* Linux offers greater **customization**, **security**, and is widely used in servers and development environments.
* Windows is known for its **user-friendly interface**, wide software support, and compatibility with most commercial applications.
* Linux distributions (distros) like **Ubuntu** are ideal for programming and system administration, whereas Windows is commonly used for general-purpose computing, gaming, and business applications.

### **Difference Between Product-Based and Service-Based Companies (in 40 Words)**

Product-based companies create and sell their own goods or software to a broad market. Service-based companies offer customized services like IT, consulting, or support to clients. Examples include Google (product-based) and TCS or Infosys (service-based).
